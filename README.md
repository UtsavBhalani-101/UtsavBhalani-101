# Utsav

Focused on **machine learning systems**, not just training models.

I care about data quality, diagnostics, failure modes, and building things that
don’t silently break.

---

## What I’m working on

- ML diagnostic engine (data risk, leakage, multicollinearity, imbalance)
- Unsupervised learning fundamentals
- Time series forecasting (statistical → ML)
- Writing structured, production-style Python

---

## How I work

- System-first, top-down
- Build before deep theory
- Learn fundamentals only when they unblock progress
- Refactor aggressively after things work

---

## Tech Stack

### Languages
- Python
- C++

### Data & ML
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Basic statistics & probability

### Tools
- Git & GitHub
- Jupyter / VS Code
- Linux basics

---

## What you’ll find here

- Diagnostic-focused ML projects
- Clean, readable implementations
- Experiments done to understand behavior, not just accuracy
- Notes embedded in code where decisions matter

---

## Direction

Long term, I want to build ML systems that are:
- interpretable
- diagnosable
- robust to bad data
- grounded in first principles

I’m not optimizing for hype or shortcuts.
